<h1>To-Do-List Console Based Application Using LinkedList </h1>
<hr>
<h4>The To-Do List app is a simple console-based application written in C++ that allows users to create a list of tasks that they need to complete. Users can add tasks to the list, mark tasks as completed, and view all tasks in the list in either the order they were added or in sorted order.

The app uses a singly linked list to store the tasks, and provides a simple menu-based interface that allows users to interact with the list. The app also includes basic error checking to ensure that the user inputs valid commands and that the list is not accessed in invalid ways.

Overall, the To-Do List app is a useful tool for anyone who wants to keep track of tasks they need to complete, and is a good example of how linked lists can be used in practical applications.</h4>
